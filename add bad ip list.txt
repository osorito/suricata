Suricata does not automatically fetch external IP blocklists or threat feeds. You need to **download the list yourself** and convert it into Suricata rule format.

### Steps to use a threat feed with Suricata:

1. **Download the list of malicious IPs**
   Example (using Emerging Threats):
   ```sh
   curl -o /tmp/compromised-ips.txt https://rules.emergingthreats.net/blockrules/compromised-ips.txt
   ```

2. **Convert the IPs into Suricata rules**
   Example script:
   ```sh
   awk '/^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$/ {print "alert ip 10.0.0.0/24 any -> "$1" any (msg:\"Outbound connection to known malware host\"; sid:1001000; rev:1;)"}' /tmp/compromised-ips.txt > /home/node/suricata/rules/malicious_ips.rules
   ```

3. **Include the new rule file in Suricataâ€™s config**
   Edit your `suricata.yaml`:
   ````yaml
   # ...existing code...
   rule-files:
     - suricata.rules
     - malicious_ips.rules
   # ...existing code...
   ````

4. **Restart Suricata**
   ```sh
   docker-compose restart
   ```

**Summary:**
Suricata does not fetch lists automatically. You must download, convert, and include them as rule files. Automate this process with a script for regular updates.
